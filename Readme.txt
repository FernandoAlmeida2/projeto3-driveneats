Projeto #03 - DrivenEats

    DriveEats is a simple version implementation of a mobile app for delivery food. In the main page the user choose in three menu options: a dish; a drink and a dessert section. By clicking in one option of each of them and not less, a proceed to check out button is enabled. A message confirmation pops up by clicking it, and doing it the request order is sent to the customer WhatsApp contact.
    Its a project for a bootcamp training, so the purpose is exclusively for learning and gaining experience. That's my first html/css + js project, so it was a little challenging but exciting to make it. Some js codes solutions weren't the best ways to solve the problems, but it is due to my lack of broader knowledge and experience in the languages involved.
