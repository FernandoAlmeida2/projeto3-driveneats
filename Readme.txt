Projeto #03 - DrivenEats

    DrivenEats is a simplified version of an implementation of a mobile app for food delivery app. On the main page, the user chooses between three menu options: a dish, a drink, and a dessert section. By clicking on one option from each of them, and not less, a "proceed to check out button" is enabled. A message confirmation pops up by clicking it, and by doing so, the request order is sent to the customer's WhatsApp contact.

    It's a project for bootcamp training, so the purpose is exclusively for learning and gaining experience. That's my first html/css + js project, so it was a little challenging but exciting to make it. Some JS code solutions weren't the best ways to solve the problems, but it is due to my lack of broader knowledge and experience in the languages involved.
